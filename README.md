# Customer List

Build a simple Front End Application that allows:

- Adding customers
- First name, last name and date of birth fields
- Editing customers
- Deleting customers
- Searching for a customer by partial name match (first or last name)
- Add mock APIs to handle the above activities

## Notes

For the purpose of this exercise first and last name are both required, this is a [Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Names](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/). I've left it in as it give a chance to demostrate some search text building understanding.

The mock API is very bare, the use of [createAsyncThunk](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createAsyncThunk) could use some improvement but it makes an interesting starting point for a client-side first design. I'd expect to expand it out to handle server timeouts and errors in a fully async fashion, with toasts messages or similar to notify users.
The current code layout should make adding PWA functionality easy as it's a redux first flow were we can write locally first and then try the API later.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
